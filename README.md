# CS3237-Lab-6

Tested on TI RTOS CC2650 SensorTag. Uses Code Composer Studio (CCS) 10.4.0 to compile.

main.c is the only file that was edited. The other files are just libraries. You may need to install other dependencies on CCS for the code to work.

You may also unzip 'code.zip' and import via CCS to flash the firmware on the SensorTag if you have one.
